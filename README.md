# Information
## Problem Statement
Voice is being used as an input for interaction in smart home devices. However, some people arenâ€™t be able to use their voice like everyone else. For example, Deaf people. We recognize the difficulty and want to ensure that everyone has access to smart home technology. As a result, we'll be utilizing computer vision to address this issue.

## Technical Challenges
We can't predict if users would gesture only the actions that are presented in real-world settings. As a result, we've utilized certain strategies to overcome, which we'll discuss in the upcoming session.
